# Flyn Orchestrator — Phase Completion Rubric

> **Purpose.** Single-pane-of-glass tracker for the 8-phase Flyn orchestrator build (spec §9). Each phase has 6-15 testable criteria. A criterion is ⬜ (not started), 🟡 (in progress / partial), or ✅ (done). A phase ships when ALL its criteria are ✅.
>
> **Method.** `outcomes_runner.py --rubric ORCHESTRATOR-PHASE-RUBRIC.md --phase N` scores the named phase by dispatching a worker against the codebase + live services, then a grader independently re-scores. Disagreement = manual look.
>
> **Done criteria use the present indicative** ("the service is live", "the test passes") — never future tense. This makes grading deterministic.
>
> **Spec:** `flyn-agent/docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-15-flyn-orchestrator-design.md`
> **Phases overview in spec §9.**

**Score: 0/7**

---

## Phase 4 — Content workflow

> **Ship gate:** One draft delivered to requester's channel; never auto-sent.

| # | Criterion | Status | Evidence | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4.1 | `workflows/content.yaml` policy | ⬜ | | |
| 4.2 | Role prompts: PM, Writer, Editor (fresh context), Fact-checker (conditional), Humanizer (optional) | ⬜ | | |

| 4.5 | Integration with existing `humanizer.md` skill via curl pattern | ⬜ | | |
| 4.6 | **Draft-only delivery enforced** — content never auto-publishes (per Flyn's existing approval rule) | ⬜ | | |
| 4.7 | "Send via X" approval flow: requester taps button → channel adapter sends | ⬜ | | |
| 4.8 | E2E ship-gate: one real draft delivered to requester's channel as DRAFT, then optionally sent on approval | ⬜ | | |

**Score: 0/8**

| 5.2 | Role prompts: PM, Executor, Validator (fresh, asserts post-conditions) | ⬜ | | |
| 5.3 | `workflows/ops/risk-rules.yaml` declarative classifier rules; risk_assess phase loads them | ⬜ | | |
| 5.4 | Risk-tier (low/medium/high/critical) computed; tier + sender role determines approver | ⬜ | | |
| 5.5 | Critical-tier requires dry-run AND Owner approval | ⬜ | | |
| 5.6 | Before-state snapshot taken; validator compares against post-state | ⬜ | | |
| 5.7 | Every ops action logged in `audit_log` table with before/after hashes | ⬜ | | |
| 5.8 | Machine downgrades from human-judged tier are not allowed (one-way escalation) | ⬜ | | |
| 5.9 | E2E ship-gate: one real low-risk ops task (rotate a test token) — validator green | ⬜ | | |

**Score: 0/9**

---

## Phase 6 — Multi-channel

> **Ship gate:** Google Chat adapter passes contract conformance suite identical to Telegram's; one round-trip from Google Chat → orchestrator → response → Google Chat. Email round-trip via `flynn@getcora.io` similar.

| # | Criterion | Status | Evidence | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 6.1 | `GoogleChatChannelAdapter` passes adapter contract conformance suite | ⬜ | | Workspace OAuth needed |
| 6.2 | Google Workspace OAuth + workspace member verification working | ⬜ | | **Blocks on external setup** |
| 6.3 | `EmailChannelAdapter` IMAP/SMTP for `flynn@getcora.io` | ⬜ | | |
| 6.4 | DNS + SPF + DKIM provisioned for `getcora.io` outbound mail | ⬜ | | **Blocks on Ryan provisioning DNS records** |
| 6.5 | SPF/DKIM verification on inbound; failed-auth → rejected unless sender in CONTACTS | ⬜ | | |
| 6.6 | Subject-line tagging convention (`[FLYN-TASK]` etc) documented | ⬜ | | |
| 6.7 | Email-based prompt injection detection (per spec §7 injection-detector) running on inbound bodies | ⬜ | | |
| 6.8 | E2E: round-trip Google Chat → orchestrator → response; round-trip email via flynn@getcora.io | ⬜ | | |

**Score: 0/8** — blocked on external DNS/Workspace setup until Ryan provisions.

## Phase 7 — Multi-PM

> **Ship gate:** Task mirrors to Linear AND Cora PM with same ID, stays in sync through state transitions.

| # | Criterion | Status | Evidence | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 7.1 | `OLWikiPMAdapter` wraps existing OL wiki API (`:8200`) | ⬜ | | Quick win — wiki already exists |
| 7.2 | OLWikiPMAdapter passes contract conformance suite | ⬜ | | |
| 7.3 | `CoraPMAdapter` against Cora's PM system | ⬜ | | **Blocks on Cora PM existing as a system** |
| 7.4 | CoraPMAdapter passes contract conformance suite | ⬜ | | |
| 7.5 | Generic webhook-based `PMAdapter` for future dashboards | ⬜ | | |
| 7.6 | E2E: task mirrors to Linear AND Cora PM with same ID; stays in sync | ⬜ | | |

**Score: 0/6** — Cora PM blocks on external dev.

## Cross-cutting (runs throughout)

These criteria are not phase-bound but should be satisfied as phases ship.

| # | Criterion | Status | Evidence | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| X.1 | `RESUME-HERE.md` reflects current shipped state (no stale entries) | 🟡 | Phase 0 entries added in T24 | Will need Phase 1+ updates |
| X.2 | `audit/_baseline.md` delta per phase (new patterns/threats surfaced) | ⬜ | | |
| X.3 | `KNOWLEDGE/<NN>-<slug>.md` entries for hard-won lessons (per §10 rule) | 🟡 | Phase 0 surfaced T03 + T12 bug patterns; not yet captured as KNOWLEDGE entries | Capture redact-list-of-dicts + hot-TTL-uses-last-updated lessons |
| X.4 | Each phase's PR has a `CHANGELOG.md` entry | ⬜ | | |
| X.5 | Monthly `drill-sanitize-rescan.sh` against `borrowed/` assets | n/a Phase 1 | Phase 0 has no borrowed/ assets shipped | |
| X.6 | `MEMORY.md` <200 lines (post-compaction-survival rule) | ✅ | Hot-tier decay enforces this; current file under threshold | |
| X.7 | No live ClawHub deps (sanitize-and-copy only) | ✅ | Phase 0 has zero ClawHub installs; sanitization protocol documented in spec §7 | |
| X.8 | All local services bind to `127.0.0.1` (not `0.0.0.0`) | ✅ | Verified for 8100, 8200, 8400 | Will recheck for 8300 in Phase 1 |
| X.9 | Cron registrations idempotent (`|| echo "(already registered)"`) | ✅ | `register-flyn-crons.sh` pattern | |

**Score: 4 ✅ + 3 🟡 + 2 ⬜ = 4/9 done**

## How to grade this rubric

```bash
cd /Users/4c/AI/openclaw/flyn-agent/deploy/outcomes
.venv/bin/python outcomes_runner.py \
  --rubric ORCHESTRATOR-PHASE-RUBRIC.md \
  --phase <N> \
  --max-iter 3
```

The runner:
1. Loads the named phase out of this file
2. Identifies all ⬜ rows for that phase
3. Dispatches a worker claude-p with the criteria + project context (codebase paths, live service curls)
4. The worker writes a candidate solution OR identifies blockers
5. A grader claude-p independently re-scores the rubric after the worker's run
6. If all phase criteria → ✅, phase is shipped; else feedback to worker, loop

The runner does NOT autonomously implement code. It scores state. Implementation happens via `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` against a phase plan, then this rubric is run for verification.

---

## Verification + integration test for the rubric itself

A meta-criterion: when this rubric is changed, the `--phase 0` run should return ALL ✅. If not, the rubric is misaligned with reality and needs fixing before it can be trusted for Phases 1+.

Run this verification:

```bash
.venv/bin/python outcomes_runner.py \
  --rubric ORCHESTRATOR-PHASE-RUBRIC.md \
  --phase 0 \
  --max-iter 1
```

Expected: all 11 ✅ rows for Phase 0 verified as still true; the 🟡 row (0.12 manual ship-gate) noted as awaiting Ryan.
